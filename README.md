# What is Taskey-React-Native 🤔 ?

It's an application build in React Native . I have used Hook to manage the state of my application . Also data will saved locally using asyncstorage . The same app is created for iPhone in swiftUI also . iOS App 
[repo](https://github.com/myawesomehub/Taskey/)

Created this application by learning about react native from scrath in a week . I think the code I have written is organised to understand but not effecient , seems like repeated code .

Still I need to fix and improve a lot in this app in future .
